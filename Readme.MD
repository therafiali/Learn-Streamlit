1. **Installation**:
    - First, you need to install Streamlit. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
      ```
      pip install streamlit
      ```
    - This command installs Streamlit, which is a Python library for creating interactive web apps from data scripts.

2. **Creating a Streamlit App**:
    - Next, create a Python file (let's call it `hello.py`).
    - Inside `hello.py`, you'll write your Streamlit app.

3. **Streamlit Basics**:
    - The code you provided is an example of a simple Streamlit app.
    - Let's go through each part:

    ```python
    import streamlit as st

    st.title("Hello World")
    ```
    - `st.title("Hello World")`: This line sets the title of your app to "Hello World". When you run your Streamlit app, you'll see this title displayed.

    ```python
    st.write("This is Rafi Ali")
    ```
    - `st.write("This is Rafi Ali")`: This line displays the text "This is Rafi Ali" on your app. You can use `st.write()` to show any text or data.

    ```python
    st.markdown("# Markdown content")
    ```
    - `st.markdown("# Markdown content")`: This line renders a markdown heading (level 1) with the text "Markdown content". You can use `st.markdown()` to display formatted text using Markdown syntax.

    ```python
    st.code("""if post == "good":
        print("Hit Like")""")
    ```
    - `st.code("""if post == "good":
        print("Hit Like")""")`: This line displays code in a code block. The code snippet checks if the variable `post` is equal to "good" and prints "Hit Like" if the condition is true.
    - Note that `post` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so you'd need to define it elsewhere in your app.

4. **Running the App**:
    - After creating `hello.py`, run it using the following command:
      ```
      streamlit run hello.py
      ```
    - This command starts a local web server and opens your app in a web browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.

5. **Interacting with Your App**:
    - When you visit the local URL, you'll see your Streamlit app with the title, text, markdown, and code snippet displayed.
    - You can modify the code in `hello.py` and see the changes reflected in real-time as you save the file.

Streamlit makes it easy to create interactive web apps directly from your Python code, without needing to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. It's a great tool for data science and machine learning projects! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
